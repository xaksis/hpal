		<p><a href="<?php echo 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/hp/dishProfile.php?gdId=33'; ?>">Bubble tea</a> (BBT if you're cool enough) is the beverage staple of Chinese society - Oh wait, that's hot tea 
		made from dried tea leaves in those cute little ceramic pots. </p>

		<p>What I mean is: bbt is awesome. It's so awesome, I've tried every flavor. It's so awesome, 
		I've probably spent close to $1000 in the past 5 years on bbt.  It's so awesome, I've contemplated getting a tattoo of bbt. 
		It's so awesome, they opened a restaurant called Saint Alps near St. Mark's Place that makes it just the way you want it.</p>
		<p>If you know me, you know that I love my culinary adventures, dining delights, and foodie goodness. 
		I also have a soft spot for finding my regular hang out places.I basically want a "Cheers" to my every palate mood. 
		For table tennis, I'm always at Spin. For bubble tea, I chose Saint Alps.</p>

		At first it was for the convenience of going to Cooper, 
		but then I found that no matter how far we moved apart, we would come back here.
		It's the place where it all started: a friendship, a bond, and a shared obsession. Obviously, I wouldn't come back 
		everyday if the place sucked. No matter the number of hot waitresses, it always will come down to quality and atmosphere. 
		It's these two aspects that make this my goto place to just hang out. Whether it was between classes, after work, or an hour 
		commute just to see some old friends, it has got that little spot in my heart (and stomach).</p>

		<p>Enough sappy stuff. I suggest the hot taro tea because it's purple and does wonders in the winter. 
		For the summer, I always get a shredded ice, but i like the classic with tapioca all the same. 
		If you haven't tried bbt, try it. If you have, try it here. Great location and open late. </p>
